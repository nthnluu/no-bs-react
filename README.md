## Tech Stack 🥞
* ⚛️ [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/docs) - a developer-friendly React framework for building web apps.
* 🎨 [**Material UI**](https://next.material-ui.com/) - an extensive and themeable React component library.
* 📚 [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react) - a tool for building, browsing, and documenting UI components in isolation.
* 🧪 [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) - a Javascript unit testing library.
* 🔬 [**React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - a lightweight utility library for unit testing React components.

## Getting Started 🤓

### Installation
Ensure you have the latest version of [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nthnluu/no-bs-react
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd no-bs-react
yarn install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Create a new component
If you browse the `src/components` directory, you'll notice how each component has its own directory containing a number of files:
* `SampleComponent` (SampleComponent obviously represents some arbitrary component)
  * `SampleComponent.tsx` - the React component code.
  * `SampleComponent.test.tsx` - the unit tests for the component.
  * `SampleComponent.stories.tsx` - the Storybook [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story) for the component.
  * `index.tsx` - a file that marks the component as the default export for the directory (you won't need to modify this file).

Of course, manually creating all these files is a whole lot of tedious work that takes away from your awesome feature-building productivity. Therefore, you're provided with a simple command line tool that can generate all of these files for you:
```bash
yarn add-component SampleComponent
```

This will generate a new component directory into `src/components`. You can move it into any directory within `src/components` as you see fit.

### Explore components via Storybook
Storybook is an insanely useful tool for develping and exploring components in isolation. Through the Storybook UI, you can view the documentation (generated from docstrings) and the props of your project's components. To launch Storybook, simple run:
```bash
yarn storybook
```

and open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser.
