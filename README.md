# No-BS React üî•
This is a production-ready React boilerplate that's designed to let you focus on building modular, well-tested features. 

## Tech Stack
* ‚öõÔ∏è [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/docs) - a developer-friendly React framework for building web apps.
* üé® [**Material UI**](https://next.material-ui.com/) - an extensive and themeable React component library.
* üìö [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react) - a tool for building, browsing, and documenting UI components in isolation.
* üß™ [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) - a Javascript unit testing library.
* üî¨ [**React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - a lightweight utility library for unit testing React components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
